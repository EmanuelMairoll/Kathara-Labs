# Switching

This section includes network scenarios on L2 switching.

**NOTE:** To have a better experience, it is suggested to use the `kathara/katharanp_vde` network plugin
(the default one). Indeed, the old plugin (`kathara/katharanp`), which is based on Linux Bridges, can interfere with 
the normal switching operations of network scenarios. 
More details on network plugins differences, can be found [here](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/NetworkPlugin).
